# Machine Learning Project: Crash Reporting Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes vehicle crash reporting data to predict injury severity using machine learning algorithms. The project includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Crash_Reporting_-_Drivers_Data.csv`, which contains information about vehicle crashes including:
- Weather conditions
- Road surface conditions
- Driver behavior and characteristics
- Vehicle information
- Crash details and outcomes
